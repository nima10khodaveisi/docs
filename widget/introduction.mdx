# Voltai Widget

The Voltai Widget is an embeddable chat interface that brings AI-powered conversations to any website. Drop it into your site with a few lines of code and give your users instant access to intelligent assistance.

## What it does

The widget appears as a floating button in the corner of your page. When clicked, it opens a chat panel where users can ask questions and get responses powered by your configured AI backend.

## Key features

- **Easy integration** — Add two files and a small script to get started
- **Customizable appearance** — Match your brand colors and styling
- **Programmatic control** — Open, close, or send messages from your own code
- **Event hooks** — React to widget state changes in your application
- **Guest mode** — Let users chat without requiring authentication

## Quick look

Here's the minimum code to add the widget to a page:

```html
<!-- Include the styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.voltai.ai/widget@latest/voltai-widget.css" />

<!-- Include the script -->
<script src="https://cdn.voltai.ai/widget@latest/voltai-widget.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize -->
<script>
  const voltai = Voltai.load({
    apiKey: 'your-api-key'
  });
</script>
```

That's it. The widget button will appear, and users can start chatting.

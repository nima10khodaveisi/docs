# Authentication

The Voltai Widget supports different authentication modes to fit your use case.

## Guest mode

Guest mode lets visitors use the chat without signing in. This is useful for public-facing support widgets where you want to minimize friction.

Enable it with the `enableGuestUser` option:

```javascript
const voltai = Voltai.load({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  enableGuestUser: true
});
```

When guest mode is enabled:
- Users can start chatting immediately
- A temporary session is created automatically
- Chat history persists across page refreshes (stored locally)

<Note>
  Guest sessions are anonymous. If you need to identify users or persist conversations long-term, consider using authenticated mode instead.
</Note>

## Bot protection with hCaptcha

To protect against automated abuse, the widget integrates with [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/). When enabled, guest users complete an invisible captcha challenge before their session is created.

This happens automatically when:
- Guest mode is enabled (`enableGuestUser: true`)
- hCaptcha is configured on your backend

The captcha runs invisibly in the background—users won't see a challenge unless suspicious activity is detected.

<Tip>
  hCaptcha configuration is handled server-side. Contact your administrator if you need to enable or adjust captcha settings.
</Tip>

## Authenticated users (coming soon)

For applications where users have accounts, the widget will support popup-based authentication. This allows:

- Users to sign in with their existing credentials
- Conversations tied to their account
- Chat history synced across devices
- Personalized responses based on user context

<Warning>
  Popup authentication is currently in development. Check back for updates or contact support for early access.
</Warning>

## How authentication works

1. **Widget loads** — The SDK initializes and checks for existing sessions
2. **Session check** — If a valid token exists locally, it's restored
3. **New session** — If no session exists and guest mode is enabled:
   - hCaptcha challenge runs (if configured)
   - A guest token is fetched from the backend
   - Token is stored locally for future visits
4. **Ready** — The `onReady` callback fires and the widget is usable

## Handling authentication errors

If authentication fails, the widget won't render. You can detect this through the `onReady` callback timing or by checking console logs during development.

Common issues:
- **Invalid API key** — Verify your API key is correct
- **hCaptcha failure** — May occur if the user's browser blocks the captcha script
- **Network errors** — Check connectivity to the backend

## Security considerations

- **API keys** are visible in client-side code. They're scoped to your domain and only allow widget operations.
- **Guest tokens** are short-lived and automatically refresh.
- **hCaptcha** adds a layer of protection against automated abuse.

For sensitive applications, authenticated mode (coming soon) provides stronger user verification.
